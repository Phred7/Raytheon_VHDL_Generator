# Raytheon_VHDL_Generator
## Overview/Description
-Problem: 
-Motivation/Why create: Hardware diversity to mitigate attacks 
-What it actually does: 
-Geneates 3 unique vhdl rom memory files from a c or asm's binary for 3 unique MSP430's simulated on 3 FPGA's
### ccs_disasembler.py
-Gets a binary generated by CCS
-Runs pique_bin to check for threats inserted in the binary
-Implements dis430.exe (provided by CCS) to generate a asm file based on the binary
### vhdl_memory_parser.py
-Gets the asm file generated by ccs_disasembler.py
-Generates 3 unique rom_memory files in vhdl that contain the program memory specifed by the asm file
-Each MSP430 implements an opcode unique to itself for each mnemonic
